# Advent of Code 2022

The target for this year is Rust.

Days use a `day-{day_of_month}` format, padding with zeroes. Parts are located in the bin directory of each day, using `part_{number}.rs` format.

# Commands

`aoc input`

> Inside a puzzle day directory, download the example input. Run to download a `input.txt` file.
>
> e.g. `cd ./day-01; aoc input`

`aoc submit`

> Inside a puzzle day directory, intelligently submit answers based on present files.
>
> e.g. `cd ./day-01; aoc submit`

`aoc day`

> Create a new day directory, such as `day-01`.

`aoc part`

> Creates new part, part 2, file.
>
> This copies the part 1 file into the bin directory.
